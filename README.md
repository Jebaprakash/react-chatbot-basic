## 🧠 How It Works

The chatbot checks the user input and responds based on predefined rules.

Supported commands:
- **hello** → Greeting message  
- **today date** → Shows today’s date  
- **flip a coin** → Random heads or tails  

If the input doesn’t match any rule, the bot responds with a fallback message.
